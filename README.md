# Hello World!
Hi! I am Austin Couch, I am a third-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor's of Science majoring in Computer Science 
and minoring in Game Design and Development. 

I am enthralled by the pull of problem solving and try my best to help others wherever I can, I absolutely 
love collaborating on projects and find joy in the communication amongst teammates and building off of and learning through each other's ideas. 

I am currently looking for a summer co-op opportunity for August 2024-May 2025 in the computer science, software engineering/development, or game 
design/development fields!

## Projects
Please take a look at my portfolio projects broken up into their separate public repositories and read their descriptions in their respective README or report files! Please keep in mind this is an evolving WIP GitHub setup and some things will be difficult to transfer from assignment deliverables into descriptive files for one-off viewing. Feel free to contact me at the information below with any questions on the provided projects or any others with objecives that could interest as their status may have prevented them from currently making my inclusion list! Thank you for your time!
